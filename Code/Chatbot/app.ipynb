      "Transformers are a type of model architecture in machine learning, particularly foundational in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI). They are designed to handle sequential data and have immense potential for various applications, such as natural language processing and market basket analysis in retail. However, transformers require large amounts of data, which can lead to biases against new, niche, and long-tail products. This limitation is addressed in Daniel M. Ringel's work, where strategies are developed to mitigate these biases, enhancing transformers' applicability in retailing.\n",
